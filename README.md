Where packs bark better, together
Your chew toys, sniffing spots, and bark logs, all side by side. For small packs to big kennels.
Fetch results quicker
Keep all your furry friends in line from sniffing out the plan to fetching the final stick. Manage big
doggy dreams and daily bone-burying tasks with custom Bark and Wag charts.
“Barky helps us keep an eye on all 30+ squirrel-chasing missions we have going at once. We can sniff
out any of them to get the full scoop right away.”
Barkley Woofington, Chief Bone Officer, MetaLab
Your online kennel
Say goodbye to scattered chew toys and different versions of the same bone. Keep everything in one
spot, so every pup has what they need to wag their tails and do their best tricks.
“Before Barky, all the best sniffing spots were locked in the heads of a few top dogs. Now every pup
feels empowered to fetch their own info and zoom around like a greyhound.”
Rufus Tailwagger, Paw-sitive Change Maker, Capgemini
Docs that keep pups in a row
4
Meeting barks, treat planning, sniffing docs — log all crucial decisions and let the pack know who’s
fetching what and when.
“We used to bark out meeting recaps all the time. But now the pack knows where to sniff if they have
a question about the plan or anything else.”
Bella Woofstein, Chief Treat Curriculum Designer, Codecademy
Start with the Free Plan
Round up your pack and start sniffing out some organization. No need to worry about time limits
or pawing over credit cards—just wag your tail and give it a try before you commit.
